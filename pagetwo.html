    <h1 id="fan">Why should you become a fan?</h1>
    <p id="badfranchise">The difficult truth is that the Timberwolves are considered one of if not the worst franchise
    in NBA history. <a href="https://www.runyourpool.com/articles/2023/04/11/the-worst-franchises-in-nba-history/" 
    target="_blank" id="bad-franchise"> 
    Here is a great example of this truth.</a>
    BUT...That just means they have nothing to lose, which means it is a great
    time to become a fan. The Timberwolves are well on their way this season and in the future to 
    become a well respected franchise and even considered a dynasty. Since they have signed multiple
    players during the offseason in the last few years and have had success when drafting recently, 
    their future is looking very bright. </p>

    city and classic jerseys are easily near the top of the NBA. Here's a look at all 5 sets of jerseys 
    the Timberwolves used this season: </p>
